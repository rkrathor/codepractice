<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="q"><u><p><strong>Delivery by a Florist</strong></p></u></div>

<p>**Please note that rerouting a delivery that we&rsquo;ve already attempted to deliver to another address may incur an additional delivery charge of $14.99 CAD.**</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="q"><u><p><strong>Delivery by </strong><strong>overnight national courier</strong></p></u></div>
<div class="a"><p>Flowers, plants, and specialty gifts shipped in gift boxes are delivered by an overnight national courier. &nbsp;and are only available for delivery in Canada. Please note that overnight national courier does not deliver to hospitals, select academic and medical institutions or post office (PO) boxes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>**Address changes for products being delivered by overnight national courier will result in a $10.00 CAD charge and order cancellations will result in loss of delivery fee.**</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="q"><u><p><strong>What if there is no florist available in my selected delivery area?</strong></p></u></div>
<div class="a"><p>If we have a verified address for the recipient we can offer you a drop ship option via overnight national courier. In this case, the overnight national courier will deliver a similar product to your intended recipient on the next available delivery date at no additional cost to you. If overnight national courier cannot deliver to your selected delivery area we will have to cancel and refund your order.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="q"><u><p><strong>Can you deliver outside of Canada and the United States?</strong></p></u></div>
<div class="a"><p>Yes! For more information please visit our <u>International Flower delivery Page</u>.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="q"><u><p><strong>Do you offer same day delivery?</strong></p></u></div>
<div class="a"><p>Absolutely! Orders placed as late as 1:00 PM in the recipient&rsquo;s time zone are eligible for same day delivery.</p></div>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="q"><u><p><strong>Do you have any delivery restrictions? </strong></p></u></div>
<div class="a"><p>We are unable to deliver to recipients in Intensive Care Units (ICU) or Critical Care Units (CCU) because most hospitals do not allow it. If your intended recipient is in a hospital ICU or CCU we will hold the order until they are moved to a regular room and is able to receive flowers. A fresh bouquet will be delivered as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Additionally, we cannot deliver to cruise ships, airport terminals, train stations, post office (P.O.) boxes, and some RR regions. We may also have limited access to college and university campuses depending on the institution&rsquo;s policies.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="q"><u><p><strong>Do you deliver to military installations? </strong></p></u></div>
<div class="a"><p>Due to the perishable nature of our products and the security policies of many military installations, we are unable to deliver to military installations.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="q"><u><p><strong>Can I specify a delivery time for my order?</strong></p></u></div>
<div class="a"><p>You may select your preferred delivery date but we do not guarantee delivery times. Our deliveries are made between the hours of 9:00 AM and 7:00 PM to residences and 9:00 AM and 5:00PM to businesses in the recipient&rsquo;s time zone. Delivery times during peak seasons are extended until 9:00 PM in the recipient&rsquo;s time zone. If we are given a 24 hour notice we can arrange for a timed delivery at a premium rate of $14.99 - this can only be arranged via telephone.&nbsp;</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="q"><u><p><strong>What if my intended recipient is not available at the time of delivery?</strong></p></u></div>
<div class="a"><p>If the recipient is not available at the delivery address specified we will typically leave the order with a neighbour or, if possible, in a safe place at the delivery address. Alternatively, we may attempt re-delivery later in the day. If this is not feasible or the recipient is unavailable when a later delivery is attempted we will leave a calling card on their door explaining what has happened. This card will provide the recipient with our contact information so they can call us and arrange for collection or re-delivery of their gift. Due to the fresh nature of our products, we cannot be held responsible for failed delivery attempts because your intended recipient is unavailable. After 24 hours of failed delivery attempts and/or lack of contact from the intended recipient items will be returned to the respective shipping location and you will be notified.</p>
