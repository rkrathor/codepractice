<p class="q"><strong style="line-height: 1.6em;"><u>What is the 1-800-FLOWERS.CA 100% Smile Guarantee</u></strong></p>

<p >Everyone at 1800Flowers.ca is passionate about delivering flowers and gifts that bring smiles. And we mean everyone. Like the President of 1800Flowers, our growers, our fantastic floral designers, even me, the guy writing the customer service section of this website. So if you OR the person who received your gift calls us with any sort of issue, it&rsquo;s a big deal to us, All of us. And we&rsquo;ll jump to make it right -- no matter what, no questions asked. We&rsquo;re happy when you&rsquo;re smiling<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">.</span></p>



<p class="q"><strong style="line-height: 1.6em;"><u>Is it safe to use my credit card online?</u></strong></p>

<p >Yes, we never send personal information, such as your credit card number over the network in a way that is readable to anyone but us. We encrypt your information and send it over the Internet using SSL (secure socket layer) technology. When your browser is in secure mode, you will notice a key or lock icon at the bottom of your browser window. 1800Flowers.ca does not rent or sell information they receive from web orders or e-mail registrations to third parties. For more information please refer to our<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">&nbsp;<u><strong><a href="http://www.1800flowers.ca/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a></strong></u>.</span></p>



<p class="q"><u><strong>What forms of payment do you accept?</strong></u></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Visa, Master Card and American Express.</span></p>



<p class="q"><strong style="line-height: 1.6em;"><u>How is the sales tax determined?</u></strong></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Taxes are based on prevailing rates in the delivery area.</span></p>



<p class="q"><strong style="line-height: 1.6em;"><u>What happens after I place an order?</u></strong></p>

<p>After placing an order online you will be directed to a confirmation page that will provide you with the invoice number pertaining to your order. This invoice number will also be sent to you via e-mail to the address you provided. Keep this number for your records and reference it in the event that you have any questions or concerns regarding your order. If you do not see a confirmation page after placing your order it means your order placement was unsuccessful and your credit card was not charged.</p>



<p class="q"><span><strong><u>How do I check the status of my order? </u></strong></span></p>

<p>Please remember that our normal delivery hours are 9:00am to 7:00pm in the recipient&#39;s time zone and sometimes the recipient is too busy or unable to call and say thank you immediately. You can see the status of any current or past orders within your account page (you will need to register on the site). The status of an order varies from being placed, through to allocation and delivery. For courier items, you will be provided with a tracking link once dispatched. For orders delivered locally, orders typically go from allocated, to accepted, to delivered. However, marking the order &quot;delivered&quot; is a manual task and not automatically updated. This status is typically updated at the end of the day. If you reason to suspect that your order may not have been delivered after having checked the order status within your account, please contact one of our advisors by submitting an email to <a href="mailto:contactus@1800flowers.ca">contactus@1800flowers.ca</a> or call us at 1-800-491-0671.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>



<p class="q"><span><strong><u>Can I specify a time for my order to be delivered?</u></strong></span></p>

<p>You may select your delivery day. In most areas of the United States and Canada, orders placed as late as 1pm in the recipient&#39;s time zone can be delivered that day (earlier times may apply to some areas and at holidays). Delivery typically takes place between 9:00am and 7:00pm. We are unable to specify a time, for example &quot;between 10am and 11am&quot; and can only stipulate that your order will be delivered during the working day.</p>



<p class="q"><strong><u>What if the recipient isn&#39;t available to receive the delivery?</u></strong></p>

<p>If the recipient is not available at the delivery address specified, we will typically leave the order with a neighbor or in a safe place at the delivery address. Alternatively, we may attempt redelivery later in the day. If this is not feasible or the recipient is unavailable when a later delivery is attempted, we will usually leave a calling card explaining what has happened. This will then allow the recipient to arrange collection of their gift locally. They may also be able to request delivery the next day. Due to the fresh nature of many of our products, we cannot be held responsible for deliveries which fail because your chosen recipient is not available at the given address. Upon 24 hours after failed delivery and/or lack of contact from the intended recipient, courier delivered items will be returned to our headquarters - we would then contact you to notify as such.</p>



<p class="q"><strong><u>What should I expect at peak holiday times?</u></strong></p>

<p>The floral and gift business experiences an increased volume of orders during major holiday periods, such as Thanksgiving, Christmas, Valentine&#39;s Day, and Mother&#39;s Day. While we ordinarily can guarantee delivery on the exact date you choose for delivery, the high volume of orders we handle during major holidays prevents us from guaranteeing delivery during those weeks. During these times, we may ask you during checkout to select alternate delivery dates in the event we cannot meet your originally requested date. Please keep this in mind when placing all your holiday orders.</p>

<p><span><strong><em>During holiday periods, please make sure to read the Important Delivery Information posted throughout the Web site.</em></strong></span></p>



<p class="q"><strong><u>Do you offer delivery outside the continental United States?</u></strong></p>

<p><span>Yes! Please visit our <a href="http://ww11.1800flowers.com/template.do?id=template4&amp;page=2010"><strong>International Flower Delivery</strong> <strong>page</strong></a>.</span></p>



<p class="q"><strong><u>Do you deliver to military installations?</u></strong></p>

<p><span>Because of the perishable nature of our flowers and the security policies of many military installations, we&#39;re unable to deliver.</span></p>



<p class="q"><u><strong>Can I make changes to an order after I place it?</strong></u></p>

<p>We typically need 24 hours&rsquo; notice to amend the details of an order. During peak events however, such as Christmas, we typically require at least 2 business days&rsquo; notice to make any such changes. Note also that we are unable to make changes to an order once it has been dispatched from either our central dispatch point, or our local supplier.</p>



<p>To make changes to your order, please email the necessary amendments and your order number to us via email at <a href="mailto:contactus@1800flowers.ca">contactus@1800flowers.ca</a> or by phone at 1-800-491-0671.</p>



<p class="q"><u><strong>Can I include a message with my order for the recipient?</strong></u></p>

<p>When placing an order you will be given the option to include a message with your gift. You will be asked for your message during the checkout process. If you do not wish to include a message, please select the &quot;I prefer not to enter a card message&quot; option. We ask that all messages are below 250 characters, to ensure that they fit neatly on our message cards. We respect the privacy of our customers. We will only ever disclose the contents of the message card to the recipient. If you do not include your name on the card (which can even be left completely blank if you wish), the recipient will not know who the order is from. If the recipient should contact us to enquire, please rest assured that we will not disclose your personal details and will reiterate to the customer that we can only disclose the contents of the customer specified message card.</p>



<p class="q"><u><strong>I want my delivery to be a surprise, can I do that?</strong></u></p>

<p>In order to provide you with the highest quality of service, we reserve the right to call recipients prior to delivery. If it is important to keep your delivery a surprise, please let us know as soon as possible by calling our customer service department at 1-800-491-0671.</p>



<p class="q"><u><strong>Why did my flowers arrive in bud form?</strong></u></p>

<p>In some cases, flowers and plants may arrive in prior-to-peak condition. This is because we like for recipients to enjoy their bouquet longer. For example, lilies may arrive in bud form and will open to full beauty within two to three days. Immediately adding lukewarm water and flower food will help speed up the blooming process.</p>



<p class="q"><u><strong>I was not pleased with my service or have a suggestion, who can I contact? </strong></u></p>

<p>We very much appreciate and welcome customer feedback. Please direct all questions, comments or concerns to contactus@1800flowers.ca</p>



<span><strong style="line-height: 1.6em;">SUBSTITUTIONS</strong></span>

<p class="q"><u><strong>Will the flowers received be true to the photo on the website?</strong></u></p>

<p>Minor substitutions may be made to your arrangement for various reasons. Specific flowers may be out of season, our product shipments may be delayed or weather conditions may affect what is in stock. The following substitution rules may apply to your order:</p>



<p>* Flowers: In arrangements of assorted flowers, colours are subject to availability and colour substitutions may apply. The colors shown online will be used if they are available even if this means substituting other kinds of flowers of greater value.</p>



<p>* Specialty flower arrangements: Such as an all rose or all lily bouquet, we will make every attempt to match the flower type but colour is subject to availability.</p>



<p>* Plants: For green and blooming plants, similar plants may be substituted of equal or greater value.</p>



<p>* Specialty plants: Such as orchids, we will make every attempt to match the plant type but colour is subject to availability.</p>



<p class="q"><u><strong>Will I be informed of substitutions? </strong></u></p>

<p>Our open substitution policy allows us to approve minor substitutions without notifying the customer. If the substitutions in question will drastically change the look an arrangement then we will typically notify you unless we are not informed by the filling florist.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="q"><u><strong>What if I am not happy with the substitutions made?</strong></u></p>

<p>We want all our customers to have a positive experience with us and will work with you to ensure satisfaction. If you are not satisfied with the substitutions applied to your order we encourage you to get in touch with us within 24 hours of delivery and provide images so we can better asses discrepancies and determine course of action.</p>



<span><strong>DISCOUNTS</strong></span>

<p class="q"><u><strong>Do you accept promotion and discount coupons?</strong></u></p>

<p>Yes. To use a promotion or discount coupon simply enter it into the &ldquo;Promo Code&rdquo; box upon checkout and your discount will apply.</p>



<p class="q"><u><strong>Can more than one discount be applied to my order?</strong></u></p>

<p>No, discounts cannot be combined. If you have two discount codes you can only apply one to your order. Please note that store credits count as discount codes so you cannot use a store credit and discount code for the same order.</p>



<p class="q"><u><strong>I&rsquo;ve placed an order and forgot to apply my discount code, what can I do? </strong></u></p>

<p>If your order has already been delivered, we unfortunately cannot apply a discount to your order. We can, however, ensure remains active for a future order. If your order has not been delivered, you will have to cancel your order and place a new one with your desired coupon code.</p>
